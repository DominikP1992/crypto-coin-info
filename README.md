# Netdata coding challenge

## Notes
- Sry for poor UI, i'm not best at UI Design 😓😓😓
- Details data in CryptoDetails component is returning `a` tags, I could use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` here, but this is not safe approach, i know that it's looks ugly but i decided to put raw string there

## Improvements 
- CryptoDetails could be spited on smaller visual components, but as for now i decided to leave it as it is, it good candidate for small or bigger refactor 😇😇😇

## Almost Last words 
- There is many places where this app could be improved (tailwindCSS, accessibility, unit tests, code splitting...), but in general overview, app meet the requirements (i hope..) 🤞🤞🤞
- Happy checking!! 🎉🎉🎉

## PS 
- I'm wondering if anybody will read this readme 🤔😅
